I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu). My advisors are [Dr. Naim Rashid](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/naim-rashid-phd/) and [Dr. Joseph Ibrahim](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/joseph-g-ibrahim-phd/).

I received my BS degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics from the [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/) in 2013.

My current research interest is in methods for handling missing data in the context of deep learning. Previously, I worked on developing a method for unsupervised clustering and feature selection of RNA-seq gene expression data.
